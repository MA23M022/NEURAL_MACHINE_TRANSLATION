Project Title :- 
    Neural Machine Translation System for Bengali-to-English Using LSTM, GRU, and Attention.

Description :-
    1. Developed a sequence-to-sequence model using LSTM and GRU architectures for Bengali-to-English translation.
    2. Implemented preprocessing techniques including tokenization, embedding layers, and attention mechanism to enhance translation quality.
    3. Evaluated the LSTM-based model using average BLEU score, achieving a peak score of 0.23, reflecting improved translation accuracy.


Note :- Model has been trained for only one epoch. This model would not give the correct result. Need training for few more epochs. This project is built for end to end purpose.
