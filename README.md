Project Title :- 
    Neural Machine Translation System for Bengali-to-English Using LSTM, GRU, and Attention.

Description :-
    1. Developed a sequence-to-sequence model using LSTM and GRU architectures for Bengali-to-English translation.
    2. Implemented preprocessing techniques including tokenization, embedding layers, and attention mechanism to enhance translation quality.
    3. Evaluated the LSTM-based model using average BLEU score, achieving a peak score of 0.23, reflecting improved translation accuracy.
